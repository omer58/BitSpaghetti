Have you ever looked at a piece of assembly and thought to yourself, "this just doesn't look complicated enough"? We have. Have you ever been awake at three in the morning, chasing down a string formatting error that just won't die? If so, then it sounds like you and I have a lot in common. Maybe we should get coffee sometime and talk about it?
